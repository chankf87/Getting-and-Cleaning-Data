## Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data

#### Overview

This repository includes the run_analysis.R script, which provides the functionality to merge data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set project at the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and calculates the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. A  codebook.md file is also included with detailed explanation of the script.

#### Execution

- Set the working directory to the folder containing the activity recognition dataset
- Run the script run_analysis.R
- The script generates an output file, tidy_data_set.txt, that contains the merged and transformed data.
